# 🌱 OptiCrop – AI-Based Crop Recommendation System

OptiCrop is a Machine Learning-based web application that recommends the most suitable crop based on soil nutrients and environmental conditions. It helps farmers make informed decisions by analyzing soil parameters and predicting the best crop for cultivation.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

Selecting the right crop is one of the biggest challenges faced by farmers. Soil nutrients and climatic conditions greatly influence crop productivity. OptiCrop uses Machine Learning to analyze these factors and instantly recommend the most suitable crop.

The application is built using **Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and Scikit-learn** and provides a simple web interface where users can enter soil and environmental parameters to receive an accurate crop recommendation.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Farmers often struggle to decide which crop is best suited for their land due to changing soil conditions and environmental factors. Incorrect crop selection can reduce yield and increase financial losses.

OptiCrop solves this problem by recommending the most suitable crop using Machine Learning based on:

- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH
- Rainfall
